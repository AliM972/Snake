# Basic Snake Game

This project contains the initial version of a classic snake game built with Java Swing. The game features a simple user interface where a snake moves around the screen, eating apples to grow longer. The goal is to eat as many apples as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's tail.

## Features
- Basic gameplay mechanics: move the snake around the screen to collect apples.
- Score tracking: the score increases with each apple the snake eats.
- Game over logic: the game ends if the snake hits the wall or itself.

## Future Enhancements
- Add a start menu with options to start a new game or exit.
- Implement levels of difficulty that affect the speed of the snake.
- Include sound effects for actions like eating an apple or game over.
- High score tracking and display on the game over screen.
- Support for customizing the appearance of the snake and the game board.

## How to Run
Ensure you have Java installed on your machine. Compile and run the `SnakeGame.java` file to start playing:

```bash
javac SnakeGame.java
java SnakeGame
